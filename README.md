# Simple scrapbook
## A simple scrapbook exercise

The present exercise consisted in creating a very simple interface using HTML, Bootstrap and some Vanilla JS. I took a small liberty from the original project, though.

* The exercise didn't ask for local storage, but I already implemented it.
* First part was solved – now there is a close button on every card.
